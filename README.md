# Rails Gear Pool Project

## Overview

This repository is for my Flatiron School Rails Portfolio Project. For this project, I used Rails to create an application called Gear Pool that allows users to donate to and rent from a communal pool of gear. Before signing in, the user can view the individual gear items, as well as the gear lists associated with them. In order to rent or donate, however, users must either sign up for an account with the app, or use google to create one for them. The user can then plan a trip from their profile page, or donate an item from the nav bar.

## Pre-requisites

Make sure that you have installed bundler. You can check this by running `gem install bundler` from your root directory in the temrinal.

## Install

Once you have cloned this repository, cd into the app parent directory and run `bundler install`. After that, run `rake db:seed` to make sure the database is set up.

## Running the App

In the terminal, start the rails server (`rails s`) and navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser of choice. This will bring you the root directory of the app, from which you can navigate from there using the nav bar at the top.
